### 🚀 About Me

I am a learner of the ALX Frontend Development Program and I want to revamp my GitHub Profile to make it stand out in my job search. This is why I started with software engineering:

> I'm passionate about building accessible, intuitive web experiences and solving real-world problems—especially those around youth unemployment. What inspires me most is the opportunity to empower underserved communities through thoughtful, inclusive technology.

My aim is to become a **leading web developer** creating **accessible technology** for **underserved communities**. That’s why I’d like to work on:
- Scalable job platforms
- Community-based learning platforms
- Open-source projects focused on accessibility and social good

---

### 💼 Current Focus
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: Frontend projects that solve real-world challenges
- 🤝 I’m open to mentorship, pair programming, and peer learning opportunities
